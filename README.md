# Project title
Investigating a relational database (DVD rental stores)

# Description
In this project, I will query the Sakila DVD Rental database.
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs.
For this project, I will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

# Dataset used
We will use the DVD rental database,the database represents the business processes of a DVD rental store.

There are 15 tables in the DVD Rental database:
* actor – stores actors data including first name and last name.
* film – stores film data such as title, release year, length, rating, etc.
* film_actor – stores the relationships between films and actors.
* category – stores film’s categories data.
* film_category- stores the relationships between films and categories.
* store – contains the store data including manager staff and address.
* inventory – stores inventory data.
* rental – stores rental data.
* payment – stores customer’s payments.
* staff – stores staff data.
* customer – stores customer data.
* address – stores address data for staff and customers
* city – stores city names.
* country – stores country names.

# Questions I'm answering in this project are :
1. What film category do families prefer to watch the most ?
2. How the two stores compare to each other ?
3. Who were the top 10 customers ?
4. What is the customer name who paid the most difference in terms of payments ?
